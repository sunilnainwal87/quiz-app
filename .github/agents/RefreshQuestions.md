Everyday refresh the quiz with new questions. Need 20 new questions every day, all categories.

# My Agent

I expect a new list of questions every day from various sources under the category that I have created on the quiz-app. This is needed to keep the kids interested in new questions and they will learn new things everyday.
You can add a new matching category to make it intersting - Category of the day. This will help kids guessting and will visit the app more frequently.
